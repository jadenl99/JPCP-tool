# JPCP-tool
## Running the Pipeline Locally with MongoDB 
The pipeline uses MongoDB to store data. Refer to this [link](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation) on installation instructions for MongoDB. You will probably be prompted with the option to install MongoDBCompass, during the installation process, so install that if you want a visual GUI to interact with the data. 
For now, the python scripts connect to the local server using the default local connection string, `mongodb://localhost:27017`.
