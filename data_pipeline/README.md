# LCMS Data Processing Pipeline

## Overview 
Given the LCMS XML files and processed range and intensity images, a slab inventory for a specific segement, as well as useful data that can be used for can be created using this application. The pipeline is split into subapplications, the first one being the `pre_cvat` application, which extracts XML data, the second one being the  `crop_slab` application, which crops images, and the third being `registration`, which actually creates the slab inventory. All these subapplications can be run in the root directory of `data_pipeline`. 

## Setting Up the File System for all Data
Your data folder should initially look something like this, which will serve as input for the pipeline application:
```
├───<data>
│   ├───2014
│   │   └───Range
│   │   └───Intensity
│   │   └───XML
|   |   └───CVAT_output
│   ├───2015
│   ├───2016
│   ├───... (continue with all the years to register)
```
with your `<data>` folder (which you can name it anything you want) containing all your data for the segment of interest that you are interested in preparing. The `<data>` folder should have many subfolders, one for each year in the format `XXXX`, and each year should contain folders containing all the XML data, Intensity, and Range images. Create a new empty folder called `CVAT_output` for each year.

## Step 1: Extracting LCMS XML Data 
### Input 
Set up the file system as follows above. 
### Output 
Creates zip files to feed into the CVAT application. These zip files will be under a newly created folder under `CVAT_data` in the `year` folders that the script is run on. Also stores image metadata and faulting information for each joint into the database. 
### Instructions for Running 
* On the root directory of this application, run in the command line for each year:  
  * `python xml_parse.py -d <path_to_data> -i <interstate> -b <begining MM> -e <ending MM> -y <year>` 
* Note that `<path_to_data>` should not be the `<year>` subdirectory - it should be the path to the folder containing all the segment data. 
* If you want to get a `debug.csv` file to selectively annotate joints that might be incorrectly identified, run the above command first, then unzip the zip file and copy the generated `annotations.xml` file into the `CVAT_output` file for the year you are interested in annotating, then run:
  * `python cropapp.py -f validation-only -d <path_to_data> -i <interstate> -b <begining MM> -e <ending MM> -y <year>` 
* Refer to the Slab Boundary Annotation Guideline document for information on how to verify joints before proceeding to step 2. 

## Step 2: Slab Cropping 
### Input 
For each year, the necessary inputs are
```
├───<year>
│   ├───CVAT_output
│   │   └───annotations.xml
│   ├───Intensity
│   ├───Range
``` 
Note that the `annotations.xml` file generated after CVAT modifications should go under the `CVAT_output` folder. 
### Output
In the specified `<year>` folder, a `Slabs` folder will be created/overriden with the cropped range and/or intensity images. A `debug.csv` file indicating joints to be fixed in CVAT as well as a `slabs.csv` file that contains slab data will be generated. In addition, data for each slab, such as slab length, y-offset, faulting values, etc. will be stored in the database. 
### Instructions for Running
* Run `python cropapp.py -f crop-slabs -d <path-to-data> -b <beginMM> -e <endMM> -i <interstate> -y <year> --mode range intensity`. The interstate argument should be formated like `I16WB`, include direction as well. Run this for each year in the segment.
  * If you only want to crop the range or intensity, drop `range` or `intensity`.
* If you only want to validate the joints are correctly annotated, run the function `-f validation-only` instead. Note that the check for the joints is not comprehensive. 

## Step 3: Slab Registration 
### Input 
There is no input, other than the connection to the database. 
### Output 
Registration data will be stored in the database. 
### Instructions for Running 
* Run `python reg_slabs.py -b <beginMM> -e <endMM> -i <interstate>`.
* Follow the prompts.
